# Calories Burnt Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the number of calories burnt during physical activities. The project is implemented in Python and leverages various machine learning techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

## Project Overview

Accurately predicting the number of calories burnt during physical activities can help individuals monitor their fitness goals more effectively. This project uses a dataset containing various physical attributes and activities to train a machine learning model that predicts calories burnt.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
- `User_ID`: Identifier for the user
- `Gender`: Gender of the user (Male/Female)
- `Age`: Age of the user
- `Height`: Height of the user (in cm)
- `Weight`: Weight of the user (in kg)
- `Duration`: Duration of the activity (in minutes)
- `Heart_Rate`: Heart rate of the user during the activity
- `Body_Temperature`: Body temperature of the user (in Celsius)
- `Calories_Burnt`: Target variable, representing the number of calories burnt

The dataset can be found in the `data/` directory.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
